1) Imported the dataset and did usual exploratory data analysis steps like checking the structure & characteristics of the dataset
2) Tried establishing a relation between the dependent and independent variable (Dependent “Count” & Independent: Workingday, Weather, Season etc)
3) Selected an appropriate test to check whether:
Working Day has effect on number of electric cycles rented
No. of cycles rented similar or different in different seasons
No. of cycles rented similar or different in different weather
Weather is dependent on season (check between 2 predictor variable)
Set up Null Hypothesis (H0)
State the alternate hypothesis (H1)
4) Checked assumptions of the test (Normality, Equal Variance).
5) Continue doing the analysis even though some assumptions were failing (levene’s test or Shapiro-wilk test) but double check using visual analysis and report wherever necessary
Set a significance level (alpha)
6) Calculated test Statistics.
7) Decision to accept or reject null hypothesis.
8) Inference from the analysis
